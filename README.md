# Where-the-ISS-at
The project, "Real-time ISS Location Tracking with Leaflet," is a web application that provides real-time tracking of the International Space Station (ISS) using the Leaflet JavaScript library.
The project is designed to display the current latitude and longitude of the ISS on an interactive map, offering a visual representation of the ISS's location as it orbits the Earth.

Features:

Real-time Tracking: The application fetches data from the "Where the ISS at?" API, providing up-to-the-minute coordinates of the ISS's location.

Interactive Map: The project utilizes Leaflet, an open-source mapping library, to display the ISS's position on an interactive map. Users can zoom in and out, and the map is powered by OpenStreetMap tiles.

Custom Icon: A custom marker icon of the ISS is used, making it easy to identify the station's location on the map.

Latitude and Longitude Display: The current latitude and longitude of the ISS are displayed on the web page, allowing users to see the exact coordinates of the space station.

Automatic Updates: The application continuously updates the ISS's position, providing a real-time view of its movement. The data is refreshed every second.
